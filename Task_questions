 This task has 3 Questions 
 The  dataset HeinzHunts has data on grocery store purchases of Hunts and Heinz ketchup.
 Each observation corresponds to one purchase occasion (of one of these brands) and consists of
 the following variables:
 1. Heinz : =1 if Heinz was purchased, =0 if Hunts was purchased
 2. PriceHeinz : Price of Heinz
 3. PriceHunts : Price of Hunts
 4. DisplHeinz : = 1 if Heinz had a store display, =0 if Heinz did not have a store display
 5. DisplHunts : = 1 if Hunts had a store display, =0 if Hunts did not have a store display
 6. FeatureHeinz : = 1 if Heinz had a store feature, =0 if Heinz did not have a store feature
 7. FeatureHunts : = 1 if Hunts had a store feature, =0 if Hunts did not have a store feature
 Question 1
 Apply the following steps and provide a screenshot of the output in your report.
 a. Create a variable LogPriceRatio = log (PriceHeinz/PriceHunts).
 b. Randomly select 75% of the data set as the training sample, remaining 25% as test
 sample. (set seed=123)
 c. Estimate a logit probability model for the probability that Heinz is purchasedâ€“ using
 LogPriceRatio, DisplHeinz, FeatureHeinz, DisplHunts, FeatureHunts as the
 explanatory variables. Include interaction terms between display and feature for a
 particular brand (e.g., DisplHeinz * FeatureHeinz).
 d. Interpret the results. What promotional methods (feature / display) are effective for
 Hunts? For Heinz? How would you interpret the results for the interaction effects?
Question 2
 Based on the estimated model in Question 1, and using the logit probability formula, calculate
 the change in predicted probability that Heinz is purchased if LogPriceRatio changes from 0.5 to
 0.55 and Heinz does not use a feature or display, while Hunts uses a feature and a display.
 Question 3
 The above estimated model is to be used for targeting customers for Hunts coupons to build
 loyalty for the brand. Coupons are to be sent to customers who are likely to buy Hunts, and not
 to customers who are likely to buy Heinz. Therefore, the coupons should be sent to customers
 whose predicted probability of buying Heinz is below a certain threshold level that needs to be
 determined based on the costs of misclassifications (incorrectly sending / not sending a coupon).
 The following information about the costs of incorrect classification is available: The cost of
 incorrectly sending a coupon to a customer who would have bought Heinz is $1.5 per customer,
 and the cost of incorrectly failing to send a coupon to a customer who would have bought Hunts
 is $0.25 per customer.
 Based on these costs, what is the optimal threshold probability level that should be used with the
 estimated model to decide which consumers should receive coupons?
